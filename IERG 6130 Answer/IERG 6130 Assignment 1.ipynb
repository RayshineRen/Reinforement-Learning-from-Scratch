    "Welecome to the assignment 1 of our RL course. The objective of this assignment is to illustrate the classic methods used in tabular reinforcement learning. \n",

    "This assignment has the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Section 1: Warm-up on the RL environment (20 points)\n",
    " - Section 2: Implementation of model-based family of algorithms: policy iteration and value iteration. (40 points)\n",
    " - Section 3: Implementation of model-free familiy of algorithms: SARSA, Q-Learning and model-free control. (40 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to go through this self-contained notebook, which contains **40 TODOs** in part of the cells that have special `[TODO]` signs. You need to finish all TODOs. Some of them may be easy such as uncommenting a line, some of them may be difficult such as implementing a function. You can find them by searching the `[TODO]` symbol. However, we suggest you to go through the documents step by step, which will give you a better sense of the content.\n",

    "In this section, we will go through the basic concepts of RL environments using OpenAI Gym. Besides, you will get the first sense of the toy environment we will use in the rest of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Gym environment should contain the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `env.step(action)` To step the environment by applying `action`. Will return four things: `observation, reward, done, info`, wherein `done` is a boolean value indicating whether this **episode** is finished. `info` may contain some information the user is interested in, we do not use it.\n",
    "2. `env.reset()` To reset the environment, back to the initial state. Will return the initial observation.\n",
    "3. `env.render()` To render the current state of the environment for human-being\n",
    "4. `env.action_space` The allowed action format. In our case, it is `Discrete(4)` which means the action is an integer in the range [0, 1, 2, 3]. Therefore the `action` for `step(action)` should obey the limit of the action space.\n",
    "5. `env.observation_space` The observation space.\n",
    "6. `env.seed(seed)` To set the random seed of the environment. So the result is replicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the word **episode** means the process that an agent interacts with the environment from the initial state to the terminal state. Within one episode, the agent will only receive one `done=True`, when it goes to the terminal state (the agent is dead or the game is over).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use \"FrozenLake8x8-v0\" as our environment. In this environment, the agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile. The meaning of each character:\n",

    "1. S : starting point, safe\n",
    "2. F : frozen surface, safe\n",
    "3. H : hole, fall to your doom\n",

In our case, given a state and an action, we need to know which state current environment would jump to, and the probability of this happens, and the reward if the transition happens. You will see that we provide you a helper function `trainer._get_transitions(state, action)` that takes state and action as input and return you a list of possible transitions.\n",

You can refer to the 5.3 Monte Carlo Control section of our textbook \"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\" to learn the details of MC control.\n",

Concretely, we maintain a list whose length is `obs_dim * action_dim`, each element of the list corresponds to a state-action pair. The list is used to store the previously happen \"return\" when the corresponding state action pair happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a dict `self.returns` to store all lists. The keys of the dict are tuples `(obs, act)`. `self.returns[(obs, act)]` is the list to store all returns that occur because of `(obs, act)` happen. We take the mean of this list (the mean of all previous returns) as the Q value of this state-action pair.\n",
